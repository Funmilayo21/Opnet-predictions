## Protocol Economics

### Revenue Streams

1. **Market Fees**
   - 2% protocol fee on all winning payouts
   - Estimated: $50K-500K monthly (at scale)

### Fee Distribution

```
Protocol Fees Distribution:
├── 40% → Staking Rewards Pool
├── 30% → Treasury (Governance)
├── 20% → Development Fund
└── 10% → Burn (Deflationary)
```

## Staking Economics

### Reward Pool Management

**Initial Allocation:** 300,000,000 PRED

**Release Schedule:**
- Year 1: 100,000,000 PRED (33.3%)
- Year 2: 80,000,000 PRED (26.7%)
- Year 3: 60,000,000 PRED (20.0%)
- Year 4: 40,000,000 PRED (13.3%)
- Year 5+: 20,000,000 PRED (6.7%)

**Reward Rate Adjustments:**
- Reviewed quarterly by governance
- Adjusted based on staking participation
- Target: 40-60% of supply staked

### Staking APY Calculation

```
APY = (Annual Rewards / Total Staked) × 100 × Lock Multiplier

Example:
- Total Staked: 200M PRED
- Annual Rewards: 50M PRED
- Base APY: (50M / 200M) × 100 = 25%
- With 1-month lock (2x multiplier): 50% APY
```

```
Monthly Rewards = (Your Liquidity / Total Liquidity) × Monthly Pool

Tokens Burned = Buyback Amount × 0.50
Treasury Add = Buyback Amount × 0.50
```

## Conclusion

PRED token is designed for long-term value accrual through:

1. **Utility**: Multiple use cases drive demand
2. **Staking**: Lock up supply, reduce velocity
3. **Burns**: Deflationary pressure
4. **Governance**: Community alignment
5. **Revenue**: Self-sustaining economics

The token economics create a flywheel effect:
- More markets → More fees → Higher staking rewards → More token demand → Higher prices → More markets

**Sustainable, deflationary, and community-governed tokenomics for long-term success.**
